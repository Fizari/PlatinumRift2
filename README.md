# PlatinumRift2
My (unfinished) bot for Codingame's PlatinumRift

This is a bot I was making some time ago. This is an AI made for the game PlatinumRift 2 on Codingame.com.
You can find all the game mechanics and rules on 
https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/platinum-rift-episode-2

The idea of the bot was to separate the pods into roles. Each role has a purpose, for example :
Defenders : Guard strategic nodes
Explorers : Go explore the map to discover the unknown nodes
Attackers : Attack strategic enemy nodes. 

It is easy to make new role with a reflective system. 

The navigation is possible with a simple dijkstra algorithm.
